# Code for my Wife :3

I post code I write for my wife to help her with stuff because I love her (and because she sometimes refuses to write quick scripts that would totally make her life way easier... \*badly tries to whistle\*)

# Sneaky Job Scheduler >:3

This script runs my wife's command to the cluster at the specified time to avoid using Newton's
stupid fucking broken scheduling system that makes her so mad! >:O Stupid Newton! Always on fire...
